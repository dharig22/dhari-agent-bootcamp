Evaluation Category,Description,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Use Case Clarity & Alignment,"Assesses how clearly the AI use case is defined, including the business objective, success criteria, problem framing, and alignment with internal priorities. A well-scoped and aligned use case sets the foundation for efficient solution design and minimizes ambiguity during execution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dataset Accessibility & Suitability,"Evaluates the availability, accessibility, and fitness of data required for the AI solution. Includes whether the data is structured, representative, privacy-compliant, and ready to be shared with an MLA for development purposes. Without suitable data, even well-defined use cases cannot be realized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Infrastructure & Tooling Readiness,"Measures the readiness of the technical environment needed to support development, testing, and deployment. Includes access to environments (cloud/on-prem), required tools (APIs, dashboards), and permissions. This ensures MLAs can begin work without major delays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Execution Feasibility,"Gauges whether the project is realistically scoped for the cohort timeline (4 months), with clear milestones, internal resource commitment, and organizational buy-in. It reflects whether the company is ready to execute efficiently once matched with an MLA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,The company has serious gaps that will be unlikely to be addressed through the course of the readiness preparation phase ,The company has significant gaps that may limit progress during execution unless addressed proactively.,The company has foundational elements in place but requires clear improvements to move toward maturity.,The company has strong readiness but could make minor adjustments to enhance execution or scalability.,The company is exceptionally well-prepared in this dimension. Minimal changes are required for readiness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Use Case Clarity & Alignment,"Use case is not aligned at all with cohort topic, and there is little to no path towards realignment","Use case is vague, too broad, or not aligned with business priorities. Confusion around problem statement or success metrics. Major refinement needed.","High-level use case is defined but lacks scope clarity, a tangible outcome, well-defined success metrics or strong alignment with business goals. Significant refinement needed.","Clearly articulated use case with good alignment to business needs, some outcome and success metrics defined; moderate refinement needed to make outcome narrow and achievable within the program, as well as tailored and specific success metrics. ","Use case is laser-focused, measurable, business-aligned, and well-articulated across technical and non-technical teams. Little-to-no refinement needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dataset Accessibility & Suitability,Data set is unavailable or has serious quantity or quality gaps which will prevent it from being usable by the MLAs.,"Data is available but is siloed, or inaccessible. Ownership unclear. Privacy, quantity, quality, or compliance risks are high.","Data exists and is partially accessible, but gaps exist in quantity, permissions, structure, or suitability. Company may need to share significant additional data, or ground truth annotations. ",Relevant datasets are accessible and fairly clean; minor restructuring or permissions may be needed.,"Fully accessible, high-quality datasets, structured and permissioned appropriately, with ownership and privacy compliance in place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Infrastructure & Tooling Readiness,No AI/ML infrastructure in place and no path towards implementation before the program. ,"No AI/ML infrastructure with a path towards having it ready in time for the program. Limited awareness of tools, environments, or compute needed.",Basic tooling available. May require setup for AI work or clarification on team environments.,"AI tooling, dev environments, and basic pipelines exist. Moderate upgrades or onboarding needed.","Company has mature MLOps practices, cloud/on-prem resources, DevOps support, and familiarity with Vector tooling guidance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Execution Feasibility,"No execution plan in place, and insufficient internal resources and support to achieve minimum objectives. ","No technical lead identified; resourcing, timelines, or roles unclear. Execution plan is vague or overly ambitious.","Roles and timelines partially scoped, but team lacks capacity or clarity.",Feasible execution plan with resourcing mostly in place; some dependencies or uncertainties remain.,"Strong technical leadership, clear timeline, appropriate scope, and cross-functional commitment from the organization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
